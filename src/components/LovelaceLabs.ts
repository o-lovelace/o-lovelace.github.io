      <span class="font-black text-primary">Lovelace</span> is a software studio that builds and operates independent products.
    </p>

    <p class="text-p text-pretty">
      We focus on turning hard technical problems into clear, well-designed, cost-efficient systems, and we develop shared tooling across our products while contributing selectively to open source and taking on a small number of partner builds when they can become repeatable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where others build complexity, we compose clarity.
